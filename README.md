My most current draft is Draft 2, the file name is Project1!
My project is hoping to highlight our overconsumption of material items. I am still working on my projects and have a few things I am still planning to add. I am planning on changing the background color along with adding a quote at the top. I also am planning on filling in some of the gaps and adding more items to the pile.
